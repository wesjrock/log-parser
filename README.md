# Log Parser

# Context
Build a parser for the games.log log file.
The games.log file is generated by the quake 3 arena server. It records all game information, when a game starts, when it ends, who killed who, who died because he fell into the void, who died injured, among others.
The parser must be able to read the file, group the data from each game, and in each game it must collect the death information.
The games.log file can be obtained here: https://gist.github.com/fabiosammy/ba973184e82e930043df8d4aa002bde4
